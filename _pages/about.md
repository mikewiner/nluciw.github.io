Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto, supervised by [Dr. Bradley MacIntosh](https://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?t=12&m=396&page=172) at Sunnybrook Research Institute. I specialize in analysis methods for mapping blood flow using MRI. My main focuses are: 1) deep learning methods to enable rapid generation of images of brain physiology; 2) multivariate statistics to study cerebral blood flow in individuals with and without neurological and psychiatric disease. For more info and links to my work, see the Research tab of this site.

I am also an active member of the Medical Biophysics and Faculty of Medicine communities, where I've served as President of our Graduate Student Association and Communications Director of the Faculty of Medicine Graduate Representation Committee. In the latter role, we negotiated a much-needed 10% stipend increase for all graduate students (>1800) in the Faculty of Medicine at UofT for the 2021/22 academic year. For more info, see the Volunteer tab of this site.

Previously, I received an MSc from the Department of Physics at UofT and a BSc in Theoretical Physics from the University of Guelph.
